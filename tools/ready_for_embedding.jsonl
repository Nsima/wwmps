We have always thought that faith comes by hearing the word of God. That's true. But it's much more than that. Faith comes not just by hearing the word of God, but principally by hearing from God. Romans 10-17. Faith comes not just by hearing the word of God. Faith comes much more importantly by hearing from God.

Kings don't beg in their domain. We have redeemed our peace and kings to reign on the earth, how we become beggars? Psalm 115 from verse 16, heaven is actual. The heaven, even the heaven are the laws, but the earth is given to the children of men. Revelation 510, he has redeemed us of our God as priests and kings and we shall reign on the earth. Now go to verse 9, they sang a new song saying that was to take the book and to open it, to open the city at all, for that was slain and has redeemed us of our God by the blood out of every country and tongue and people and nations. No ratio of discrimination and as it dimmed us onto our God as priests and kings and we shall reign on the earth.

Faith is enforcing the will of God by going the ways of God. Faith is enforcing the will of God. By going the ways of God. The book in your hand called the Bible is a bank of his will. That book is a bank of his will. The word testament connotes covenant. Covenant connotes will. So it is the will of God that permeates the whole of scriptures. And at the same time it is accompanied with the ways of God. It's the bank of his will. Equally loaded with his ways. So you don't only know what his will is. It tells you which way to go to get across. So faith is not just knowing the will of God. Faith is knowing the will of God and discovering the ways of God and going on it.

Faith is knowing the will of God and discovering the ways of God and going on it. It's a combination of the will and the ways of God. So the Bible is a bank of his will. Couple with his ways. That's why I said any faith that seeks to make God absolutely responsible for the events of your life is an irresponsible faith. This is his will and this is his ways that guarantee the actualization of his will. We all agree that it is the will of God that not should perish. I many agree with that. For God so loved the world he gave us only because his son, the house of ability, say him, should not perish but have everlasting life. That is his will is with that. He does not desire that anyone should perish but that all should come to repentance. That's his will. But men and brothers, what shall we do? That's what they said in the upper room.

You believe in Christ and then you are saved. And 3,000 people went and they knew the way of God. They got saved. So it's not just knowing his will. If you don't know his ways, his will will never come to pass. So for every of his will, the hour is established ways for getting across. For instance, the Bible says, is that ask, receive it. He does seek it, find it. And unto him, that not get the door shall be opened. So there is an open God has an open policy to answer prayers. But what way must I pray for God to answer?

So you know his will, you believe in the answer of his will, and you go to him in prayers and pray in the name of Jesus, whatever you ask the Father in my name. So you have his ways outlined in scriptures to help you actualize his will. Oh, Lord, doubt that answer it prayers on Tudisha or flesh come. So God is a prayer answering God.

So faith is a spiritual device through which we enforce the will of God by going his established ways in actualizing his will. Think for instance, the Bible says, from scriptures, it is not reasonable to give the children's food and cast it out to dogs. In chapter 7 of Mark, it's speaking to the paraphernalian woman. That simply means that every child of God is entitled to health. Amen? And then the woman said, oh, but the dogs can also eat the crumbs that fall from the table.

Surely as bone on our grave and carried our pains, the judgment of our peace was laid upon him, and by size we are healed. Good. But when two blind men came to him, have mercy on our son of David. He said, do you believe that I, the son of man, am able to do this? They say, yeah, Lord. He said, according to your faith, be it unto you. Matthew 9, 27 to 29.

You don't get healed with tears. There are many wrong things we do. Thank you that is to walk it out. Can you imagine putting a wrong key into a padlock? How long will we have to stay?
