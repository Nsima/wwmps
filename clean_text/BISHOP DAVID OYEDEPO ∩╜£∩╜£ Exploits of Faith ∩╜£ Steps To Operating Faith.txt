Oh, let no one live here without a lifetime encounter with you. Thank you, Father. Lord, go through my lips tonight. Let your world go forth with power. Let multitude experience your touch tonight. As your world goes forth, let your healing power flow through. Let your deliverance power flow through. Thank you, Father. In Jesus' precious life. You won't have to tell anybody you came. Everybody will see the effect of your life. Every time God speaks. Everyone on everything here. When God speaks, everyone on everything here. Everyone. And everything here. And whoever hears among men. They enjoy the miracle of everything lining up to ensure that that world delivers. When you receive this war, you are empowered to become what the world says. God said to Moses, speak to the rock and to bring forth water and the rock heart. When God said it, the rock had it and the rock had to push out water from wherever. He said, stand down to go forward. The sea heart and the sea gave way. He said, the sea saw them. It fled. When God said to Moses, search for your hand. And the land of Egypt will be buffeted with lies. L-I-C-E. The lies are, and together from everywhere where they were, to invade Egypt, to torment Pharaoh and his people. And God said, search for your hand and the land of Egypt will be filled with swarms of lies. And they said, the lies are. And they had to land up to obey. They all invaded Egypt because when God speaks, everyone on everything here. Go to the sea and the first fish you get, open the mouth and take the coin. The fish had. The fish had it and went into the net. By itself. So every truth you receive, every opposition lies up to ensure it comes to a path. When God speaks, devil's here. He said, was casting out evil spirits with his words. Tonight I'd like you to be on the tower with an eagerness to receive from the Lord. What this event carries. Waves of glory. We had a testimony last Sunday, one of my sons here, Adaza, if I remember the name, the son was caught with kidney failure four years ago. And he said, the heart may say in 2007, there are things who are only at Shiloh to come here anyway. So he picked the Shiloh tapes and sat with it. The kidney came back. And four years after himself and his son was standing here on Sunday. Everything lined up. Shiloh is a kind of potter's house. He shows you the wall. It's a goat to the potter's house. And I will cause you to hear my word there. Shiloh is not our event. It's not a convention. No, it's a prophetic platform. All done by God as a meeting point with him. So I believe that here, at Shiloh, God is going to appear to you in this world. Last Sunday we had a testimony of one of us, twenty-eight years in waiting. They got married in 1983. And they came to Shiloh last year and slept in their cars. They just believed that was the opportunity. And last Sunday we saw the baby boy on the platform. Somebody's going to catch his own encanta here for a lifetime change that has been waiting for. Thank you, Jesus. What is God's purpose for setting up Shiloh? Joshua chapter 18 and verse 1 to 3. What is God's purpose for setting up Shiloh? He said the whole congregation of Shiloh and Israel assembled together at Shiloh, and set up the tabanaku of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them. So it's a platform for confinement of dominion. The land was subdued before them. Shiloh is set up as a platform of empowerment that will culminate in dominion of the church, the dominion of the saints, and the land was subdued before them. And verse 2. He said, and they are remained among the human beings seven tribes out of twelve. Seven tribes which had not yet received the inheritance. Seven out of twelve. And then verse 3 said, and Joshua said unto them, how long are you slacked to go to possess the land with the Lord your God? The God of your Father has given to you. So it's a place where your inheritance is hastily delivered. So it's a place where you contact your own inheritance. It's a place where your inheritance is placed in your hand. And the land, that's why people come into Shiloh and they return with humbling testimonies. Somebody got somebody to get them down here last year and according to his testimony, he has six houses in one year. Those things belong to him but will not be delivered except you will contact the platform for the delivery of it. I want to believe that every hanging inheritance of every individual at Shiloh this year will be hastily delivered. They shall be speedily delivered. In the name of Jesus, what the good news is, the apostolic days are here again. Who are apostles? According to scriptures, apostles are essentially custodians of candom mysteries. Apostles are custodians of candom mysteries. Paul said in Ephesians 3. So for this course, I pour the presence of Jesus Christ for you, Gentiles. If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given on to me towards you, how, by revelation, he made known unto me the mystery as I wrote before in few words. Apostles are custodians of candom mysteries. Apostles are carriers of candom mysteries. Apostles of Christ be as a special gospel. A special gospel. In Romans chapter 2, verse 3, I mean verse 16, he said, God is going to join the secrets of man by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel, that's Paul speaking, according to my gospel, Apostles are bearers of special messages, special gospel to the body of Christ. In Romans 16 and verse 25, he said, God that has power to establish you, according to the revelation of the mystery, you know, according to my gospel, according to my gospel, 16 verse 25 to 26, very interesting, every apostle of Christ is sent with a special message to the body. What we call prophets in the Old Testament is what is known as Apostle in the New Testament. Some 74, verse 9 to 12. Some 74, verse 9 to 12. We see not our signs. There is no more in the prophet. It is there in the amongers that know how long. How long shall the adversary approach? And how long shall the enemy blaspheme, blaspheme in the enemy forever? Lock down the right hand and block it out of their bosom. Prophes in the Old Testament are carriers of signs, but Apostles are carriers of signs in the New Testament. The seal of Apostles is signs and wonders. Second Corinthians chapter 12, verse 12. The seal of Apostles is signs and wonders. George's prophets are commanders of signs and wonders in the Old Testament. Apostles are commanders of signs and wonders in the New Testament. And by the hands of the Apostles were many signs and wonders brought among the people. As chapter 5, verse 12 to 16. Many signs and wonders were brought among the people by the hands of the Apostles. Many signs and wonders were brought. Very interestingly also, Apostles are dispensationalists. They sign a new era. Apostles sign a new era. They come with a special message that signers a new era. They come with a special message that signers a new era. Every true Apostle carries news from heaven. Paul said, a dispensational of the gospel is committed to me. First Corinthians chapter 9, verse 7, and collusion chapter 1, verse 25. We also understand from Scripture that Apostles are territorial commanders. He said, the same God that was at work in Peter to the apostleship of the Gentiles, the same is mighty through me to the apostleship of the Gentiles. Galatians chapter 2, verse 8. Paul had the Jews as his domain. Peter had the Jews as his domain. And Paul has the Gentiles as his domain. So, Apostles have assigned territories over which the command dominion. Apostles are kingdom-based setters. They are men that lay foundation for the move of God part time. I have laid the foundations and all those are built in on it. First Corinthians 3, 10. Let everyone be careful how he builds on it. So, Apostles are peace setters. They set a peace for the new thing. That God is out doing. Paul said, I have laid the foundations and all those are built in on it. So, they lay foundations for all those to build on. Now, because Apostles are custodians of kingdom mysteries and kingdom mysteries, the purpose of supernatural insight, which is what provokes supernatural faith. Resorting and wonder healing, wonder deliverances, wonder victories, wonder breakthroughs, wonder fruitfulness, wonder wealth, wonder testimonies. Because faith comes by healing. So, the deeper your insight, the greater your command and the greater the manifestation of the power of God. So, Apostles are men and women of depth. And by the adapt, great faith is theater. And by the great faith of men, great manifestations. Just feel over the entire atmosphere. On the 29th of June, 1992, the Lord spoke to me in these very words. It's time for change. He said, prepare yourself for the imminent change of faith I've talked about over the years. And I said, what? That is the era of science and wonders. It's a new dimension of a higher order. So begin to declare total war against the kingdom of darkness. Proclaim liberty and fascist power step into the realm of anointing. Then he said to me, it's time for the restitution. And it says, I merely placement restoration of all things with the mouth of the Lord as spoken. It's time to administer the fascism of the spirit that will enable the sins take up their inheritance in Christ. Then he said, I am launching you to the apostoly phase of your ministry for pay setting. Therefore, work before me and without a perfect, and I will perform every word of mine in your direction. I open up the gates of nations to you today. Therefore, with all sense of humility, I want to declare God as graciously entrusted me with the gospel of life ration for this generation. God as graciously entrusted me with the gospel of life ration for this generation. And we are going to see full scale apostonic manifestation at Shiloh 2011. We've never heard anything near what we have heard this year as testimonies confirming the breakthrough on limited agenda. I do remain last week in Abu Jal, or two weeks now, somebody was dancing and pressing God and a board came out of our body and sat on the chair where she was sitting. They said, look, look, look, look, the board could not fly. She took a pair of shoes and hit it, and the board died. So I'm carrying a lump like that in one of the services. You know, my husband is sometimes from four weeks now, and then the power of God fell in the midst of praise, and then the growth vanished. What? And the professor was sitting behind her and saw a board flew out of our body. And jumped up to say, I saw the board when it flew out. And the board flew out of the floor to disappear. There are no things that are written anywhere. They're just new order. It's a new order. So whatever has never happened before to any man is happening to someone right here. somebody was in India and smitten with cancer of the bones in June and as the one was going for he said he saw as if I stepped to the arrow he said look look he stepped to a room that was the end of cancer of the bones went back to the hospital Monday they couldn't find it again they returned back home there was pending a fortune a week took him going I've heard a few things but I've never heard for day old child for day dead for day child dead for four days and the Wimbledon thank you Jesus glory to God thank you Jesus glory to God and on the four days the child woke up now something is about hitting somebody right here please understand that the events here are simply apostolic they are not make ups they are simply apostolic they are simply apostolic I made the sale of apostolic and I'm sorry for you in this event God told me as I saw the array of suffering humanity and I was crying I'm willing and God I said why Lord it's a but from the beginning it was not so and now the hour has come to live with the entire world from all oppressions of the devil through the preach of the world of faith and I'm sending you to under stage this task someone was imprisoned in Venezuela because the plane of their family was stolen I've never heard his plane been stolen some drug barons may be hijacked the plane and commanded the pilots to get off and so when they located the plane oh they said they are doing on the plane but it was topped with a hundred so they drew the man into the prison and they gave me a copy of bond to win in Venezuela language he read that book finish they call him this is your discharge and I killed him the hour has come to live read the world this is last two weeks last two weeks recent the book was in Spanish God has vow to restore you to your original state and she know twenty eleven will mark the error of that restoration your life whatever was not so at the beginning we no longer be found in your life God or then us to go from glory to glory you know and promise for verse eight eighteen it said the path of a just man is as a shining light and a shines more and more onto the perfect day that means the path of the justified the path of the redeem is ordained to be as a shining light the shines more and more and more and more onto Jesus we don't stagnation must end here forever in your life stagnation must end here finally your life the people we are predestinated he has called and once he has called he has justified and one he has justified he has glorified so your justification is ordained for glorification Romans eight twenty nine thirty this glorification is until we come into the fullness of the stature of Christ onto a perfect man so the main the benchmark is very high the benchmark is what the benchmark is very high until we come into the fullness of the stature of Christ onto a perfect man the good news is many people on this earth will be demonstrating heavily the left Thai practically it will be said of men of men this generation again the gods have come down to us in the likeness of men I said briefly when we are declaring this machine open this event open that glory is in degrees there is one glory of the sun another glory of the moon and that glory of the stars and one star divided from another glory in the world they talk about stars thus the fathers they can go but in the kingdom we talk about the sun of righteousness so you move from star to moon from moon to sun and I can tell you nobody will attempt going to the sun the heat will make it ever last in the impossible you can move around the moon you can mess up around the sun Jesus is the bright and the minister and Jesus also the son of righteousness so we have all it takes to move from one level to another onto the ultimate the purpose of Shiloh twenty eleven is to create a platform of an end day glory in your life just moving from one level to another moving from one level to another you say ask with you all they must in the glass so it is by the world of God that we change level we change level by insight revelation is what produces transformation revelation is what generates transformation and be it transformed by the renewing of your mind thank you Jesus so we began this series tonight unveiling the wonders of faith unveiling the wonders of faith what does the glory of God imply simply the power of God the glory of God simply implies the manifestation of the power of God the world glory in biblical terms is all about the manifestation or display of the power of God among men Matthew chapter nine and verse one to eight and verse eight people explain and glorify God who has given such power on to men Matthew chapter eight and when the multitude saw it the marvel Matthew nine and glorify God who had given such power on to men they saw the power of God on display and the marvel and glorified God who has given such power on to men you know the same said in some 63 verse one to three oh Lord my God only will I seek thee my soul tested for thee am I flesh lonely for thee lead and trusty learn to see die power and die glory it is the manifestation of his power that produces or generates the glory in Matthew 15 verse chapter one the multitude to wonder when they saw the power of God in display and glorified the God of Israel they wondered and glorified the God of Israel a Mark chapter two and verse 12 is said we have never seen it in this manner so webs of glory will produce things that people have never seen so the year 2012 what has never been written what has never been said what has never occurred we begin to happen in your own life we have never seen it in this manner therefore webs of glory is about waves of the manifestation of God's power waves of the worship of the spirit and power but faith is the covenant trigger for the manifestation of the power of God faith is it faith is the covenant trigger for the manifestation of God's power the woman who did your blood touched the hem of his government and power flew and Jesus said die faith has made the home so your faith has pulled the power and has established the glory has changed your position if you believe you will see the glory of God well I want to believe God that the only dissimeting heavens will come down for you therefore to grow from faith to faith is to go from glory to glory what is faith faith is a spiritual virtue with unlimited power for growth so with me faith is a spiritual virtue with unlimited power for growth faith is a spiritual virtue with unlimited power for growth if you can't believe all things are possible to him that believe then he went on and said but with man this is impossible but no with God for with God that means your faith can grow to a point where you are preded practically in God's class Mark 923 and Mark 1027 contrasting the two scriptures that means your faith can get you to a device status where you command the same authority as God does unlimited power, unlimited capacity for growth faith is a spiritual virtue with unlimited capacity for growth unlimited capacity for growth he said who ever believes in man the walks that I do shall he do also and greater walks than this shall he do John 1412 and that is Stephen greater walks than Jesus did will demand do if he will grow his faith to that level that makes faith a spiritual virtue with unlimited capacity for growth unlimited capacity for growth number two faith is a spiritual explosive that devastates the power of the enemy and establishes the dominion of the same Ephesians 6 verse 16 above all taking the shield of faith we are way too shall be able to quench all the fearing darts of the devil so your faith can grow to a position we are no gang gobs of the wicked cast on your way can I get your email some armed robbers took a cost at one of us at 5.30 a.m. and took his phone and saw my picture they said whose picture is this? he said that's my father ah please get your phone get your money, get your bag we didn't take anything from you please we didn't take anything from you we

recognize you it's like Jesus I know I'm poor I know it's about who are you? so fear this not just religious talk it's a maze of spiritual empowerment for dominion fear is a maze of spiritual empowerment for dominion somebody had this phone and then some fellows are costing them and the phone ran and had me speaking in tongues they said who is that the same thing? please get your things

just have to go when they hear my son my son they just have to go and can I tell you this? that's the level God has ordained every of his children to pray to he said he are gods and all of you are children of the motorcycle that's what makes faith is spiritual virtue with unlimited capacity for growth and love for begging situations it's time to start taking charge of situations Shadrachanabendigo said we are not careful to answer you in this matters too it came our God don't we saw it's able to deliver us and we deliver us from your heart but even if it does not we will never bow and God deliver them from the fiat because they trusted and they are gone that's a level of faith that can put fire where it belongs somebody is blessed here because they trusted and they are gone and if fire set up against you and your family the ones who set up will be called Zumbaid number three faith is a spiritual currency of endless team of value and host same value in all

chapter three verse 27 a man can receive nothing he said we give him from above James chapter one verse five and six let him ask him faith or let him not think he should receive anything from God so whatever God has to talk faith has access good has access to bring home faith holds the highest possessive power in the world of the spirit whatever belongs to you we cheaply sweatlessly reach you by faith everything about this ministry is faith acquired everything there is no one man or woman here including myself who can claim we did it there is no man living or dead who can say we made it

In Romans 10, verse 12, now there is no different between the Jews and the Greek. The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. There is no different between the white and the black, the yellow and the gray. The same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. There is common and economic explosion in the body of Christ. I mean every church, every true church, every church of the living God, will be flowing on a very strange frequency of divine fortune. Strange fortune. Strange fortune. We are not error. We are in the days of his Jewish. All you need is adequate light to walk in it. We are in the days of his Jewish. This ministry is swimming in divine fortune. Swimming in divine fortune. If you get on the key and you stay on key, you just find yourself flowing in it. There is a way that happens so much trouble so that God can have the opportunity to lift his people and they will find us. Why are things working for them? And things are not working for us. They will come. They will come. Within the next one year, many of you will come and live in surprise. You will become a living surprise. Can I hear your loudness, amen? What is unique about Bible faith? Bible faith is of the heart. Romans 10, 10 with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. Number two, Bible faith is a spiritual means for tapping into the power of God. I am not ashamed of the gospel. It is the power of God on the salvation to everyone that believes. It is a spiritual means of tapping into the power of God. Romans 1, 6, 10, John 1, 12. As many as receive the world, he give power to become the sense of God. John 1, 12. Number three, Bible faith manifests its power through our tongue. If you will say to this month and without a movement, come to the sea. I shall know that in your heart. You shall know whatever you say. Number four, Bible faith dominates the world of the spirit. By quenching all the fiery darts of the devil. It dominates the world of the spirit. By quenching all the fiery darts of the devil. Number five, Bible faith brings God's hand to bear on man's life for exploits. It brings God's hand to bear on your life for exploits. As they are 53, verse 1, what believe their report and unto whom is the Lord revealed. When faith comes alive, God's hand is set forth, which empowers you to do the unusual. Let's look at the first mission of Bible faith. Faith comes by hearing and hearing from God. Romans 10, 17. Say with me faith comes by hearing and hearing from God. And hearing from God. Faith comes by hearing and hearing from God. All of the heroes of faith, at least dead in Hebrews chapter 12, they were Muslim men and women that had from God. Faith comes by hearing from God. Faith comes by hearing from God. Faith comes by hearing from God. And in Psalm 29 verse 3 to 11, we saw the beauty, the power of the voice of God. He said the voice of the Lord is upon the waters. The Almighty turned on it. The voice of the Lord is upon many waters. Behind every verse of scriptures is the voice of God. When you see the waters, they are talking about the Bible. They are done by the voice of God. So the voice of the Lord is upon the world of God. May you hear that voice on this Monday. We have acquired this beyond human imaginations. And our propaganda procedure came in from Psalm 24 verse 1. The earth is the Lord and the fullness, they are all. He said, I will never beg a man to use what I own. The earth is mine. No body qualifies to be called landlord. You all met landlord here, you didn't buy it. He said the earth is the Lord and the fullness, they are all. The world and all that dwell in them. That was when the struggle to get land ended. When we went to eat, it's over. It's my part here. That's how we got 740 acres in Abuja. We have never sought for to get any land. I never said it so before possible. You can't say it. I heard from God. I own the land and I will not have to beg any man to use my land. And faith comes by hearing and hearing from God. Faith comes by hearing and hearing from God. You will hear the voice of God on this month. On the 8th, on 9th of September, the Lord said to me, Psalm 34 verse 5, my son, you have two eyes. Can you make one to look up and one to look down? It didn't work. At any time, you are looking on to men or men. Never come to be looking on to me. But if you will keep your eyes on me, you will never be ashamed. That's when I shot my eyes against myself or anybody as they miss or get into where I'm going. They looked onto him and they were like them. And their face were no more ashamed. Then from that, they said, my son, you have two eyes. Because the voice of the Lord is behind every verse of Scripture. The voice of the Lord is behind every verse of Scripture. Thank you. Determine chapter 8 verse 18, March 22, 1982, the Lord said to me, my son, my prosperity plan is not a promise. So it does not answer to prayers. It's not a promise. It does not respect fasting. My prosperity plan is a covenant. Until your part is played, I am not committed. Simple, fit comment by hearing. From that day till I die, giving from what a God's kingdom, title is a delight like breathing. I've never prayed, everybody. Fit comes by hearing from God. Fit comes by hearing from God. Fit comes by hearing from God. No, just lead in the letters. No, just cram in the logos. But assessing the ramah behind the logos. So there we have 22 viewing centers in Lagos. This city alone. And God spoke to me, March 84. Keep showing the seed. And as the glass grows, the sheep will come for it. And keep the glass gray. And the sheep will lie down there. For he may get me to lie down on gray pastures. The voice of God sanded from three scriptures put together. And that became the mid three behind our unstoppable child growth. Unstoppable child growth. We created only 4000 plus says last year in Lagos. And this year, 9,422, new says. When God told us from scriptures, it sequels your future. When God told us from scriptures, that sequels your glorious future. Fit coming by hearing and hearing from God. I myself took my infirmity. That was what spoke to me. I took. It's already concluded. It's not that I'm coming. That's I forget. I'm very busy. I already took my infirmity. And I bore your sicknesses. So you can be free from them. That becomes a negative transaction that is irrevocable. It was sealed with the blood of Jesus. The supreme court of heaven. So if you can't hear any sickness in your body tonight, according to the prophet's scriptures, it is declared illegal. On the behalf of my voice this night, I declare you here in the name of Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Fit comes by hearing and hearing from God. You cannot hear Him and doubt Him. Abraham was fully persuaded that what God has spoken is also a buttoe performed. Where you hear from God every doubt dies. Nobody could confuse Abraham. This year we've heard about four different miracle babies without menstrual period. They have passed menopause. I mean, God made it in 68. Where will menopause be? As passed. 20 years. As passed. There is no need for menopause. Just have children. Whatever is a question mark on your life, I cost them tonight in the name of Jesus. Fit comes by hearing and hearing from God. You cannot hear Him and doubt Him. You know, Abraham hard. Take your son. Your own lesson is it. Home download it. Equate him forever. The voice of the Lord is my dear than the verse of many waters. He stood up on him in the morning. You can't hear from God and doubt Him. The reason why you live in doubt is your only heart from preachers who have never heard from God. You have only heart from preachers who have never heard from God. No one would take his own lesson and do one sacrifice if he has no heart from God. But here are they from God destroys doubts. He said God is able to raise him back from the dead. So if he says you caught his neck, maybe he wants to show his power again. So I'm going. I'm talking knife and put it on his neck. I'm going to say stop. Now I know that you fear me. No one doubts God if he hears from him. Some 93 verse 4. The Lord is my dear than many waters. He said the Lord on high is my dear than the noise of many waters. When the waters began to make noise, fear came to Peter and it began to sink. Doubt came because the noise of the sea is to trigger doubt. Where said the Lord on high is my dear than the noise of every doubt from the sea. When God told me this is the place, every doubt died. Every doubt died. May this mountain be to each one a mountain of voices. May this mountain be to you a mountain of voices. So we saw that the fate of Abraham anchored on access to the voice of God. And God said to Abraham, get out of their country and he moved. The voice of the Lord is the voice of faith. The voice of the Lord is the voice of glory. The voice of the Lord is the voice of faith. The voice of the Lord is the voice of glory. Jesus received from the Father, honoured and glory. When there came such a voice from the excellent glory. Second Peter chapter 1 and verse 17. He received from the Father, honoured and glory. And where you believe you see the glory of God. He received when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory. This is my beloved son in whom I'm well pleased. And this voice we have. And what with him on the mountain. May your access to this voice of glory come open today. Somebody believe that let me allow this amen. Let me allow this amen. Let me allow this amen. You cannot hear him and doubt him. Two, you cannot hear him and not believe him. As 27, verse 22, 25, they want to see. And for 14 days they were struggling for their lives. I'm passed to them on the 14 days and look, brethren. They are stood by me last night, an engine of the Lord. Who I am, who I'm on myself. Say, there shall be no laws. Therefore I believe God. There shall be as God has spoken. So why don't you eat? So he took the bread, opened it and broke it. And then everybody began to eat. The voice of the Lord destroyed doubt and uncertainty. He destroyed doubt and uncertainty. And they all arrived there safely. The good news is this. Many of you are in the midst of crisis today. But by the voice of the Lord from this mountain, God is turning your conscience into testimony. God is turning your conscience into testimony. God is turning your conscience into testimony. God is turning your conscience into testimony. Nothing destroys the whole of doubt. That the voice of His Majesty. My prayer is that tonight marks that beginning of an era in your life that shall be from glory to glory. It shall be from glory to glory. It shall be from glory to glory. So the voice of the Lord comes through the wall. One it auto comes through the ministry. Gifts that God sends to us. Instead though the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, we will not remove your teacher from you, and your ears will hear a word behind you as they teach you. This is the way, walk in it. As I said, chapter 30, verse 21. So God minutes passed to us or speaks to us. His voice comes some of the times behind the voice of those who teach us. It comes through the things that they write. It comes through the things that we listen to. So the messengers of God are also channels through which God speaks to us. They are saying something and you are hearing something. They are saying something and you are hearing something from God. They are saying something and you are hearing something from God. I was reading the book, God's Plum for Your Life, following God's Plum for Your Life by Connecticut. February, 1985, and the Lord said to me, as I was taught in the book, He said, why are you asking me for another lamb? When you have not used the one I give you? And I said, what? He said, put down those buildings, make an airship structure, use closed circuit television to accommodate more crowd, terminate with an office tower, and then you talk to me later. Now, you see, the voice came straight. I wasn't praying about it, but behind the writing came the voice. Something must get to you this time. I said, something must get to you this time. Somebody believed, let me hear your loudness, amen. Let me hear your loudness, amen. 1996, I was reading a book by T. L. Osborne, the purpose of Pentecost, and then God turned that, and showed me the Holy Spirit as a person. And I had the voice of His Majesty for the first time in my life. God speaks to us through the ministry of prophets, apostles, evangelists and teachers. I saw for the first time in my life that the Holy Ghost was a person. I didn't know that before. And I said, if you are truly a person now, lead me to where these fellows are. I don't want to ask anybody. And I had them say, go forward. And I went, came to a crowd, a tea junction, where do I go from here? Make a left. God, another tea junction, where do I go from here? Make a left. Can I tell you this sense? God led me in a time so where people are living without any human guide. Make a left. Make a left. Go forward. Make a left. And then, we don't ask anybody. He led me by himself. I mean, I can't tell you the Holy Ghost is more than enough. To lead you to any where God has ordained you to be. From that day till now, I'm still here in a God clearly. May this mountain bring your healing of every deafness. The same 1976, written in a book, The Man God uses. God spoke to me. Matthew 633. He says, You first, my kingdom. Go for all it demands. And all these things that others are dying together, they shall be added to you. That's nothing. That's scripture. That is the voice of God. It was turning me like tonic. Intesticating me like wine. I had to write a vow to make it my lifetime. Here is my wife. She had to sign it. I was like wine. Of course she went. It clicked me. I saw it as the jackpot of life. That dude is one thing, you won't ask for any other thing. There will simply be others today. Amen. This year is a wonderful year for everybody. And also for my family. Amen. We are blessed my home this year with two grand sounds. Is it a grand yet? It's a big grand year, amen. I didn't have to pray for any. He said, Sikki forced my kingdom and all these things that others are dying to get. You know I'll be shouting that ever since. People are tired, but I'm not tired. That is where my life-funded journey that gave me the best of you. I do have the best of me. I wasn't caught on ministry. No, I was just saying, Jesus said, boy, Jesus crazy boy. I heard from him September 12, 1976. We signed the document. This is 2011. I'm still bouncing. I'll tell you. Evil, my big shot. That is the devil. Oh, this is the furnace. I'm dying to get it. Somebody was captured by ritual killers and the flyer from his back pocket flew out and came to the front. A ritual killer said, what? Ah! Ah! Ah! I wasn't there. Just a photograph. Sikki forced the kingdom to go and it's righteousness and all these things that others are dying to get. I have never prayed for a car. I've never confessed one. I've never prayed for a plane. There was an opportunity to pray. He doesn't stand to get the airplane. And I told them now. And we bought it now. We changed to collect back. Amen. Till like that, there's no day I would be without plane in my life again. There's no day. He's only the number you might bother about. The number I may need to help. So the different location would go for different ones. I can't tell you. Ah! This is God! Stop looking at him. God is teaching you. This is God. Now you see. I like it to understand this. Sikki forced the kingdom of God. That was a voice. So read it and write 10 books. Creates a platform to hear from God. Read it and write 10 books. Creates a platform to hear from God. Oswa Jess Smith was the platform through which I had God's voice. And all these things that others are dying. If you see, tell anybody's book. They got it from me. It's not them God told. God told me. Whether they refer to me or not, they got it from me. All these things that others are dying to get. They shall be added to you. So from this time on, it will be glorious additions in your life. I was reading the book of Ezekiel 1977 July. And on the third day, you know, God is a covenant-keeping girl. So the time speaks on the third day. On the third day, the voice of Oswa Jess came. Behold, I have touched your tongue with the cold of fire. And from holy place, whatever is considered irreparable. This is one night you will live to remember in your life. How many are expecting the master soldier to show up tonight? Get up on your feet, everybody. Thank you, Jesus. Get up on your feet. He has not asked the seat of Jacob to seek him in vain. I have been justified to be glorified. So no devil can shame me by me. I have been justified to be glorified. And no devil can shame me by me. Here are what the Bible says. And my people shall never be ashamed. Whatever represent shame around your life. Lift up your two hands and begin to cause it in the name of the Lord. Begin to cause it in the name of the Lord. I have touched your tongue. Lift up your two hands and begin to cause it in the name of the Lord. Lift up your two hands and begin to cause it in the name of the Lord. Thank you King Unquince for watching. This powerful message by Bishop David de Poe.
